# Hue Harbor
Simplifying color comparison my way. Effortlessly organize and copy hex codes for color exploration. 

See it live [here](https://jvsonica.github.io/hueharbor/).

### Working on:

- ~~Removing colors from list~~;
- ~~Sorting animations~~;
- Light/Dark mode;
- Selectable background for the page despite mode;
- ~~Serving via GitHub pages~~;
- Visually indicate that something was copied to clipboard
